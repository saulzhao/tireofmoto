## Two common formats
- Metric: **90/90-18** = width 90mm / aspect 90% / rim 18"
- Inch: **3.00-18** = approx width 3.00" / rim 18"

## Quick rules that prevent mistakes
1. Keep **rim diameter** the same (18 means 18").
2. Check **rim width range** and **clearance** for wider tires.
3. Load & speed rating matter for high-speed use.
